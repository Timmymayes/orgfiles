* Poker Goals
- Start with ~$1500 bankroll (10 buy ins at 1/3)
- Play 100 hours a month to get the $400 rake back and win @ $10 an hour on average
  - This should thus equate to $1400 a month added to the bankroll.
- Look to aggressively shot take at  2/3 when i have ~15 buy ins aka $400 x 15 = $6,000
- Occassional shot take when games are bat at 1/3 (play very low variance maybe even a $200 buy in strategy)
- End of year goal $16,000 in the bankroll and regularly playing 2/3. Start with $10 win rate and work towards $30.
