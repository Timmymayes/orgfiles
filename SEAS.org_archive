** Speaking Event Planning
*** Speaker Information
Phil Mershon, Director of Experience with Social Media Examiner
**** Event Title - Creating Memorable Experiences with Phil Mershon
**** Standing Topics
***** Planning Ahead
Talk about the value of planning ahead and how it is important for reducing costs. Roll this into having the right people. Planning earlier lets you secure the best talent which is usually booked further out. 
***** Having the right people
Having the right people make all the difference, across every domain. Potentially tie in some examples from the recent SMMW event.
***** Project Management
Tie the right people into managing the people who manage the project for you. 
***** Paying for the Output of a thing not the time spent
Talk about how you're paying for an end result and the experience / value that the people you hire bring in. It's not always something that comes out in the line items of an invoice. 
***** Budget is a way to maximize your creativity
Phil will need to add information to this.

3.

Remind them we know its not the final version of your job and we expect that. We make a plan so we can change it.

Last Email (2-3 weeks after proposal)

3 question survey

2 days after the event - Expect a final budget update in next 48 hours

Having an idea of when your future events are will enable us to build a better plan and execute on resources earlier which will improve the quality of the show. 

Referrals - post event email. Are there other people in your org that put together events you could introduce us to. Are there any other people in the industry that you would recommend us to. Please help us connect.

** Drip Campaigns
*** Drip 1 - Preparing Quote
Preparing Quote -> Trigger on Entering Discovery complete
Pick a date (starting from 3 days for now) to review the proposal

Do you feel this is the right spend for your money

3rd email thinking about numbers offer option to talk to Zack

4th email - planning takes time the sooner you confirm the sooner we do these things:
1. secure the best team
2. front end planning and design work
3.

Remind them we know its not the final version of your job and we expect that. We make a plan so we can change it.

Last Email (2-3 weeks after proposal)
The reason there is a deadline on your event  is that resources are precious. We have not begun securing your crew and if we cannot get this confirmed there are other jobs we're commiting to. 

Termination date on propsal and this drip is a reminder. Need a good until date.
Copy the sales person

Quote follow up from show support with account manager setup


*** Drip 2 - Event Follow up
Follow up comes from Zack and starts before the event happens
5 days before the event - hey I'm zack want to remind you team is here to support you whatever changes / concerns you have please convey them to your production manager. I'm here to support you etc. 

As soon as the event is over say hey i know its the last day of your event I'm looking forward to your feedback here's a link for your feedback.
3 question survey

2 days after the event - Expect a final budget update in next 48 hours

Having an idea of when your future events are will enable us to build a better plan and execute on resources earlier which will improve the quality of the show. 

Referrals - post event email. Are there other people in your org that put together events you could introduce us to. Are there any other people in the industry that you would recommend us to. Please help us connect.

Month further down the road. Have fond memories of your event? Have you solidifeid your event schedules for the next 12 months.
