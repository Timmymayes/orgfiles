** Speaking Event Planning
*** Speaker Information
Phil Mershon, Director of Experience with Social Media Examiner
**** Event Title - Creating Memorable Experiences with Phil Mershon
**** Standing Topics
***** Planning Ahead
Talk about the value of planning ahead and how it is important for reducing costs. Roll this into having the right people. Planning earlier lets you secure the best talent which is usually booked further out. 
***** Having the right people
Having the right people make all the difference, across every domain. Potentially tie in some examples from the recent SMMW event.
***** Project Management
Tie the right people into managing the people who manage the project for you. 
***** Paying for the Output of a thing not the time spent
Talk about how you're paying for an end result and the experience / value that the people you hire bring in. It's not always something that comes out in the line items of an invoice. 
***** Budget is a way to maximize your creativity
Phil will need to add information to this.
