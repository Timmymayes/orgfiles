*** Vegan Caviar (Macedonian ajvar)
I learned this Macedonian "vegan caviar" from Beryl Shereshewsky's youtube cooking show -- an episode on toast. If you haven't checked out her show, I absolutely love it. Here's the episode: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IStY1BVoUKA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IStY1BVoUKA)

Ajvar is so good, feels fancy, and I could have eaten with a spoon.

Here's how to make it:

Take:

- 2 red bell peppers
- 1 eggplant

Roast (475 for 30 minutes) until black (not totally black but you know, like black spots) Cool. Take off skin.

Puree in food processor with

- 1 garlic clove, smashed

Reduce in nonstick until thickened (30 minutes) and then add:

- 1 ½ tsp white wine vinegar
- ⅛ tsp ground black pepper-
- up to a 1 tsp of salt

Eat cold or hot.

Sprinkle with parsley if you're taking a picture for reddit.
