***** Intro cVideo                                      :MEDIA:OCTORAFFE:
- Illustrated vs real video?
- What length?
  - ~10 minutes seems standard
- What should we do here?
  
  I'm thinking we do a mixed media video with us sitting and talking to the camera with the game setup, this can help convey that we're a small team and our personality.  It should also be much cheaper overall production cost/time.  It could also leverage people who have seen us at conventions remembering us as well as show who we are so when people see us in the future they know who we are.

  Example of a modern kickstarter doing just this: [[https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ivstudios/tend-0?ref=discovery_category_ending_soon&total_hits=46447&category_id=34][Tend]] - 7,741 backers for $725,432 total. IV Studio has done several of these and I feel like it ends up being really authentic feeling and like you know the people behind the games.I

  Alternatively we could do a fully animated one but time and cost might be an issue.

  We can also go the [[https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/cardboardalchemy/flamecraft?ref=discovery_category_most_funded&total_hits=50605&category_id=34][Flamecraft]] route with more focus on the art.

*** Gen Con Update!
Hello!

We wanted to send an update regarding Octoraffe's presence at Gen Con 2024. We were unsure that we would be able to attend and as such there was a delay getting game slots setup. We have confirmed we're able to attend and have setup the following demo events:

<insert gaming window info>

We're are still planning to launch the kickstarter for Bagged & Boarded this year and are focusing our demos on it. We will however have Brick & Mortar and Rat Race available to play outside of the official gaming slots.  If you'd like to connect with us and play one of these games please join our Discord channel, if you have not, and tag Nick there to coordinate a play session.

<insert images of Brick & Mortar and Rat Race>

*** Brick & Mortar Available at Gen Con and All Play  (not sure if it will be available so cut if not)
We will have a limited supply of Brick & Mortar with us at Gen Con this year if you'd like to pick up a copy. As usual we'll also have some of the promo starting stores with us as well.

If you're not attending Gen Con we're proud to announce that Octoraffe is partnering with ALL Play for game fulfilment and post Kickstarter sales. Brick & Mortar is available there already (link) and we will be using them for Bagged & Boarded as well. All Play has been a warm and welcoming partner and we're excited to work with them!

*** Bagged & Boarded Kickstarter Update
We do not have a set date for the kickstarter but do plan to launch this year. We've been working diligently on the art and are very excited. We have finalized art for all 24 characters, box art  and everything for the tokens and money. Currently we are finishing up bonus cards, scoring cards and player boards.  The final piece will be the rulebook and  game board. For the game board we're working hard to ensure we get the UI/UX as good as possible. Take a look at some of what we have ready below!

<insert bagged & boarded art to share>

*** Rat Race and beyond
- Rat race is largely complete from a mechanical perspective and will only be needing art. This game might just be our personal favorite we've made so far.

- We also have a yet untitled Zombie game that is a much earlier stage of production that we're really excited about. This one is a ways from having a lot to show but we're excited about it's potential. 

While it has taken longer thatn we wanted to get Bagged and Boarded to kickstarter Tyler and I have working to  ensure we have games in the pipeline. We are a small company of just a few people so we're balancing life alongside building processes that enable us to design and produce games for the forseeable future. Your patience and support means mroe to us than you know.
