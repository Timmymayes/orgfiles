|-------------------------------------------+-----------------------|


*** Gratitude
Grateful for steady job and no pay cuts

*** Highs / Wins
- Things are going great at work with the on-boarding of Troy. Zack is a bit more out of my hair and marketing is rolling forward.
- Really dialing in my emacs configs, workflows etc and learning more lisp.
- Feel like I'm getting a fresh start on health, habits etc
- Got CPAP machine so I can start sleeping proper
- Bagged & Boarded is getting closer and closer to the kickstarter timing

*** Lows /  Losses
- Poker bankroll wiped out due to downswing and IRL expense (moving)
- First month of breakup. Hit by random sadness / awkwardness
- Not enough time/tasks are logged. 
  
*** Learnings
- I need to fight tooth and nail to not let myself put things off and just get them done.
- I have time. I have a future outside of the failing relationship

**** Discoveries                                                :Disovery:
***** Proper CPAP usage might save me quite a bit of time. But I need to get my circadian rythmns on point and diet/exercise.
