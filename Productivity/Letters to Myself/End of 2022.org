Hello Tyler,

I'm writing to you from last year. Trippy and weird but also kind of cool. I really hope this is the year you get your shit fully together. You have some issues but you also have some potential. I don't want you to be the same person or in the same place that you are right now. You're overweight and getting older. Your blood pressure needs to come down. I know you're not gonna go to the doctor until you bring that down so it really needs to happen. Your game isn't published, your programming study is inconsistent and you might actually be losing your relationship. Oh and you're not only broke but in debt. You need to fix this shit.

That being said you're here writing this which means you might actually be willing to start making some changes. Hopefully this letter can serve you well in trying times through the year. Or maybe you won't actually read it until next year, if then. If you're actually reading this I commend you. One thing done.

You have some irons in the fire but you need to learn to execute. You need to take responsibility seriously. You need to take your life and your age and your career seriously. Your parents are aging, you'll lose them eventually. Spend more time with them. Spend more time with your brother. Maybe start a new family? I think I want that actually but its a bit late and scary.  If my relationship with Jess weathers this upcoming move (July) and you're able to career switch and make some money, maybe just maybe you can be having a kid in the next 3-5 years.

That would be a big deal. I need to get Jess's family to sign off on me and to do that I need to lose weight, make/save money and have a proper career lined up. Time to man up and make some shit happen.

See you on the other side.

Best,
Tyler
