*** Continuous Professional Development Observations & questions
- Goal & Activity capture pushes into his CPD.org (activity capture seems to fill from active goals)
  - CPD.org seems to have a line at the top that might be defining custom todo states for that file?!
  - Using tables to track status, started, completed stuff.
  - Seems to ahve latex settings for export
  - Table is long and doesn't wrap but extends off screen
  - State fills in dates
** UTF-8 Encoding Issue Fix                                  :NOTE:FIX:

:PROPERTIES:

:END:
 [2023-08-01 Tue 22:11]

 Probably want to use a property drawer and maybe some ids? Also look into the CPD.org stuff with goals 

*** Overview
I want to be able to see all of my "events" on a calendar. I may need to parse events out of the core tasks.org file for this, not fully sure yet. Ideally I can grab only from one heading or do some sort of filtering with Calfw.

For now we just have it setup as a default and we'll want to build out our views and see how things are going. I imagine full days will start to look really full since it shows completed items as well.

Need to implement gnuplot and do actual metric capture to create larger data sets such that I'd be able view my data over
longer
time periods.

** Package Ideas
*** Side peak help buffer with hotkeys (Think Treemacs)
This would be an addon for help likely that enable you to define command groupings that you can call up as side bars for contextual reference. This could be logical groupings like "org uml hotkeys" or "narrow/widen" or it could be "trying to internalize". These are essentially notes and hotkeys for "cheatsheet" type learning tools. 
** Package improvement updates
*** Ace Window Scroll
An addon that lets you bind a command to scroll a specific ace window when multilpe are open.
