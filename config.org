*** Continuous Professional Development Observations & questions
- Goal & Activity capture pushes into his CPD.org (activity capture seems to fill from active goals)
  - CPD.org seems to have a line at the top that might be defining custom todo states for that file?!
  - Using tables to track status, started, completed stuff.
  - Seems to ahve latex settings for export
  - Table is long and doesn't wrap but extends off screen
  - State fills in dates
** UTF-8 Encoding Issue Fix                                  :NOTE:FIX:

** Package Ideas
*** Side peak help buffer with hotkeys (Think Treemacs)
This would be an addon for help likely that enable you to define command groupings that you can call up as side bars for contextual reference. This could be logical groupings like "org uml hotkeys" or "narrow/widen" or it could be "trying to internalize". These are essentially notes and hotkeys for "cheatsheet" type learning tools. 
** Package improvement updates
*** Ace Window Scroll
An addon that lets you bind a command to scroll a specific ace window when multilpe are open.
