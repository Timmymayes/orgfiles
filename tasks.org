*** Design Ideas
**** Token Pools as Dice Solution

One of the elements I really love is a "token bag" as a customizable and changeable "die". A die is really just a randomizer. Traditionally one roles a die and uses a numeric result to create an effect. Arkham's use of numbers and symbols within one bag allowed for a "univeral" symbol to mean different thins in different scenarios. This is hyper useful. 

One game I want to design is a BIG box sprawling RPG. My goal for this RPG is to use various randomizers that can change and be customized without being a nightmare to track. The problem is this could become an exercise in tedium and fiddly-ness that kills the experience. 

I think I have a solution.  

2 token bags. One is your "scenario bag" that is built for the scenario and modulates as you go through the campaign. The other is empty until used. The token pools that sit "around" the game at a campaign level are stored in the game box in a collection of "tuck boxes" or bins that can easily have tokens added or removed if an event prompts it. It can also be "called" from the box, dumped into the  2nd bag, a token selected, then everything returned to the bins. 

This could also lead to the concept of each player having a token bag that they "build" over time and modulate chance on. This would only be used for certain cards / types of cards in their setup. (should we go with "cards")

**** Worker Placement Mechanism

A worker placement where workers have unique abilities and slowly get more powerful over time whether you want them to or not.

You can steal your opponents‚Äô workers by offering them a higher salary.

You can also protect your own workers by offering them a higher salary, but it‚Äôs almost never a good idea because you can always counter offer when they get stolen.

This could be really cool for a corporate or startup focused game.

**** Game Idea - Start Ups

## Overview

Start ups is a game about starting companies, taking them public then starting new companies. 

The core idea for the game loop is as follows: 

‚Üí Start a company

‚Üí Work to make it profitable

‚Üí Sell it off or close it if you cannot

‚Üí Take it public when you can ( no player stock)

Public companies run themselves via a simple automata

As companies go public and run they will create a tapestry or texture to the game state / market. New companies you start must take this into account. 

I'd love to have a company creation system that isn't just "here is company x it's the same every game" I'd rather player work to build companies from "component" ideas. (dry erase company tiles so you can name them as you like would be cool) Those completed companies then create the tapestry of what is out there. Possible vectors of company creation would relate to their company and  products

Products

- Cost ( cheap, standard, luxury)
- Quality ( cheap, standard, amazing)

Company

- Brand level ( wholesale brands to cult followed) (marketing plays into this)
- Sustainability?

Companies would have a rating system that changes as the market interacts. So goods costed as luxury but with a quality of cheap)  would make a lot of initial value and have some initial influence but fall off out of the game more quicly as their intiial high rating would decrease quickly over time

**** Game Idea - Don't Starve
**** Don't starve game ideas

Exploration uses a time track so that for example picking grass is one space but digging up the grass needs a shovel and is 2 spaces. 

Matching symbols on a run can dictate certain rare doodads. For example road tiles are non action tokens that basically let you pull another token but get X on a single run and you remove them and have found the pig King. 

Doodad stack order impacts how much time to go and utilize a thing. 

Doodads flip when used and respawn as needed. 

Fires let you use more of  your base at night

You may stay in base during the day to cook, heal or just use things you couldn't at night due to lack of fires

Once you've crafted a thing you can during exploration. 

Paper bosses with add on potential sculpted player characters. 

Sculpted buildings and monsters as add ONS

Temp bases possible when night approaches. No hammer means you lose your stuff. When packing up. 

When return to base you can take the safe way back or a new way which gets you more resources but is more dangerous

You can return early and convert your time to base actions.

***** Resourcess

[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkr2ylxzQ0E][Exporting art from don't starve]]

**** Game Ideas - Eons (season based game idea)

Conversing with Nick led to some interesting ideation for EONS. 

Shifting away from a deck to a bag per season for each player. 

Shared common areas and play boards similar to perhaps altiplano. The key theming here is the relationship to the land and potential for ‚Äúover fishing‚Äù or ‚Äúover farming‚Äù an area. 

Action resolution affects what goes into other bags.

**** World Building RPG

Large Open World RPG system where playres randomize and decide elements that maek up the world the explore. Crafting system that allows you to build and experience a world.

Large amount of cards in the base set with bonus expansion modules and big storage box etc

Arkham esque campaign setup with creatures, people, traps, events items etc. However the encounter card sets tend to either be wholly constructed via setup seeding systems ( Prologue, backstory, narrator or 4h wall breaker systems)

 

Bosses of campaigns will tie into world events, locations, items and player actions etc. 

Blank names for "named characters" but add on for named character sticker sheets with random names to choose from for faster character creation

Locations will have enccounter decks as well. Subtyping will have differnt set types that shuffle together. Region, Biome, Locale

In this way you might encounter a spider because you're in a cave biome, but you might also discover a lost artifact from that region becuase it was lost in a cave in that region.  The local cards might mean you find the corpse of a boy from the nearby town. 

A lot of information to manage but if I can pull this off...

 

Stacking player trays ( track two types of resources. micro & macro) simply swap which is on top to easily switch what "game layer" you're in. Side tray or dial to track what applys to both sides.

Token bags for seeding "World seed bags)" these will hold state but can change as the game progresses. As the world shifts to darkness you addmore of certain monster tokens to the token seed bag or maybe world events are draining the world of the essence of Light (or fire or poison) and the elemental seed bag has its  matching token type reduced. 

<aside>
üí° Maybe have a lighter resolution mode for combat for peole who find it too fiddly and don't want to do every combat. Maybe even hybridization where you care a lot abut this combat so you don't want to "take the avgs"

</aside>

**** Fantasy RPG Guild Game

It could be interesting if each player runs a guild that has characters they control but it's not a win or lose game it's semi-cooperative with the goal of each player to tell the stories of their characters throughout the game fulfilling their destinies. So each player runs a guild of adventurers and they can send some of their adventures onto quests with other players adventures but their motivation is the destiny of their characters this would enable storytelling but also play er ownership

It would also drive exploration trying to find and accomplish things for certain character groups might require exploring the map to find enemies a certain types or villain leaders

**** The Machine

## Overview

The machine is a "conveyer" belt style shared programming game experience. The start of the game will be a starting "map" or configuration. This will consist of conveyer belts, splitters,  arms ( i.e. inserters), machines (inputs & outputs), material sources (inputs), and finished product outputs. 

Each round the machine will run. All input goods will go in and cycle through. 

Players will take turns adding to / modifying the machine trying to modulate it for their benefit. 

Add a splitter and a new line of conveyer to move some product to somewhere else. Rotate an arm, change out machines, add new resource inputs, move belts to other inputs.

**** Netrunning / Hacking Game in the style of twilight struggle

Essentially have a map with points of interest that is the represnetation of a city as its "network" with points of interest. So you can do things like hacking certain corps or the police station etc. 

The hacking element is very much like twilight struggle where you play events or use them for hacking. So it could be programs that you either use to increase your presense in a location or play the event. Not sure if it would have events you play for the opponent. 

Might make a solid mini-game as part of a larger cyber punk game.

**** Asymmetric game about starting small businesses

A game where essential resources are represented by cubes/ meebles etc but that each player is asymmetrically starting a business. Almost like "modules" and expansion content would be new business types. 

**** Strategy Game Built on the idea of the fermi paradox

Rogue like game that has quick iterations where you try to advance civilization through the epocs of time until you reach the ability to scale from type 1, 2 and 3 civilizations. 

I'ts a god/game or Civilization game where you are nuturing a planet through MANY civilizaiotns. on a technology path. As new technologies are developed by different civilizations they will naturally wage war on each other. You're playing as an advanced civilization that wants to cultivate this new civ. 

The civilization is AI.

**** Oath Style "Evolution" focused game

Oath change over time meta feature but with "evolution and mutation" at the forefront. 

**** Space RPG Game
***** Overview

Take the rough idea of FTL but expand it. Solo or co-op game.  

### Game has 3 altitudes.

1. Planet level: Exploration, resource gathering, questing, (all done as crew). There will be TOO many planets to scour by hand in the mid to late game which will beef up the ship based scanning & exploring
2. Solar System level:  Ship exploration, (finding planets), scanning planets ( to save time), ship to ship interactions ( combat, conversations etc)
3. Galaxy Level: This is really the "base" level as you'll be on your mega-ship using a starmap to travel between galaxies. This level will be where long term research, pruduction, storage and ship building happen.

Each new game is a new galaxy with a random seed.  Players will build and upgrade ships .

The game loop will be to restart in new seeds each time a little stronger starting out. 

Each successive loop takes you deeper into space where harder planet types and alien races will be encountered.

Each time you do a stasis-jump to reset the game you choose what you can take.  Eventually even upgrading how big your jump ship is which allows going in with mroe starting stuff. Research always carrys through

 

Dungeons could be reality rifts that players enter and they could be almost anythhinng

***** Maneuver Deck

Each ship has a base maneuver hand/deck which operates mechanically as "hand management". Level up your crew for new manevers based on crews and class of ship. 

Maneuvers will be thematic and spend resources / generate or restore others.

***** Delving Focus

Dungeon crawling space themed rpg campaign game. Target game player size is solo with variant for 2 player co-op. 

Goal of the game is to have the scenarios work off of an encounter deck but with everything in a singl ebox. 

Ships are cardboard player boards which are your characer, as your "crew" will change throughout the game. You are the captain. 

The ship will have different pre-built layouts with rooms, which will have inset spaces for upgrades. (polymino?)

Cubes in trays to track resources. 

Crew represented by meeples placed on spaces of the ship..

crew can go on planetary missions

Encounter types will vary i.e. planetside, local space, cruiser level ship for jumping systems

setup home base and setup things like trade routes that provide recurring benefits & resources.

build a planet typing ( as well as"regions" like central worlds vs rim worlds)

Faction system to track where you are with certain races / groups

**** Web Design Board Game
***** Overview

## Initial thoughts:

- The player board presents itself ( right there in the picture)
- Systems & mechanisms:
    - Adding certain functions or aesthetics will cost Time & money.
    - Stock images as a binder that people will bid or buy from ( like that marketing game aldrin showed us)

## Alternative idea: StartUp‚¨ÜÔ∏è

a team based party game ( ala captain sonar)  where are creating startup companies. Each player takes on a different role with a different scope of "mini-game"

- CEO - leadership & decision making
- CTO - Technical design ( like the above app & website design style)
- CMO - Marketing mini game
- CFO - Monitors the money and tries to avert crisis ( everyone else spends)
- COO - helps design the processess the company goes through ( maybe it's a flow chart style )
- Each player could hire people to flesh out thier company.
    - Could be a draft row with drop off that gets cheaper the further down the row they are.
    - Could be a phase where new candidates come out and you secretly bid.
    - Org chart like fcm maybe...

Need a product development system.

[[file:images/WebDesign-game.png][web design style]]

**** Auto-battler Campaign Game (video game)

## Overview

Each player is a planet wide AI that rose from a non_space capable civilization> as the planet started to lose resources you recognized the need to achieve space travel to reap the bounty of the stars. After your initial encounters with low intelligence planet bound species you finally bump into another of your kind. Another AI  with the same needs that took the same path as you. A fight over resources has begun. 

This is an autobattler campaign based RTS like game. 

The game is turn based ( with an over arching timer) which players use resources to develop technology, design and upgrade units (including thier battle ai)  and deploy them to take over planets with a goal of gaining resources. 

Battles on planets are considered on-going and the ai will work to build, dattack and defend based on their programming and your overall edicts regarding the planet. 

The number of planets in the universe are finite and the early game is about establishing your core then expanding. 

Battles happen continuiously meaning that you spend your time on a planning UI which uses "turns" each turn that passes will advance technologies etc. you can jump to allt he planets you have forces or scouting on and send out more units to those locations. This ebb and flow seeks to emulate more of a war than a battle.

**** Supply Chains
***** Overview

# Overview

Economic game of shared incentive with a ‚Äúboard‚Äù that is built out like a supply chain or tech tree. Flow or output is established during a turn and remains as set until obsolescence (like rusting a train but rusting a technology or end good type)

## Types of producers

- Raw resources
- Intermediate producers
- End goods

### Raw Resources

These producers are hyper important and start the supply chain.  These are important to build and generate very consistent resources at a lower value output.  e.g. Coal, Water, Iron, etc. The first ‚Äúage‚Äù or ‚Äúera‚Äù has fewer lower grade options and more unlock as the game stages out. Probaly 3.

### Intermediate producers

These are the producers that take in either raw resources or other intermediate producers their output is either intermediary or end good. These sell for middle of the road money. Unused goods might stockpile? Possible warehousing tech is needed ( if we go with tech)

End Goods

These goods sell for lots of money.  But require various intermediate producers to actually sell. 

 

## Inspirations:

- Indonesia - keep the interesting bits of mergers, purchasing power, operations (production + logistics) but simplify the operational tracking while keeping the interesting decisions
- Container - Price changing
- FCM - Marketing i.e. demand control

## Potential ‚Äúphases‚Äù (initial thoughts)

- Determine Turn order (bid or other)
- Innovate
- purchase / merger
- Operate
- Marketing

## Core aspects of operations:

1. Production (generation & conversion of goods)
2. Logistics (goods movement)
3. Marketing  (demand or growth)

## Shared Incentive

Ultimately this is a stock style game and payouts are done on a share bases much like 18xx or indonesia

Look at either a merger mechanism or a stock split mechanism. 

Look into forced purchases & player money

Ultimately players should be competing but also to a degree working together. 

Bankrupcty?

## Decision Space & Interactivity

Player order, funds, capability and cause effect decision space on the board should help drive decisions and interactivity. There should be latitude across the types of goods and the overall ‚Äúsupply chain‚Äù options for players to maneuver but it must be tight enough for really hard decisions and the ability to get in each others way.

## Spatial element

Ultimately the players work to unlock a known tech tree in each era. The board or bits that players will lay down and produce with will be in parity with a printed player aid tech tree for each era. The changeable bits are what players choose to (or not to) unlock in both the aspects of putting a new ‚Äúnode‚Äù of the tree into play and/or increasing production or transport ability along the nodes. Players will ‚Äúinvest‚Äù in pieces of the supply chain. 

For example at the base level coal, water, copper iron will be available these will start with a set amount of ‚Äúoutput‚Äù based on the initial bids of players ownership / setup.  Each type of tile will have a ‚Äúproduction‚Äù value on it that players can pay to move up while also adding a colored cube from their supply to mark. (this marks share value). 

 Raw goods can have their output increased or new sources funded. 

Logistics throughput can be increased by both type (truck, boat, train, plane [special) as a base and volume as a multiplier. Logistics can also be ‚Äúsplit‚Äù at times to go to multiple places. 

End goods can increase production efficiency. 

## Marketing & Demand tracking.

A board will be needed to track the demand of end goods.  Marketing can increase the demand and as goods are sold ( in turn order) their prices come down ( like in clans of caldonia)

## Random Bits

- Possible there is a set amount of output from raw producers. Turn order is determined by a bid but that bid is then used to pay for boosting raw producers in some interesting way, maybe reverse turn order spend the bids for bonus production.
    - Example:
        - Bids for turn order are $0, $5, $10, $12
            - the $0 bid goes 4th but spends the $12
            - The $5 bid goes 3rd and spends the $10 bid
            - The $10 bid goes 2nd and spends the $5 bid
            - The $12 bid goes 1st and sends player 1s bid.
        - If there are 5 players the player who wins 1st gets to spend $0
- Players have a tech tree like food chains tree ish. Like a flow chart.
    - 2 fold. ‚ÄúFront Era 1,
- As ‚Äúeras‚Äù end the board is assessed and the state of the intermediary producers is ‚Äúchecked and set‚Äù as the new baseline.

**** Propoganda Party Game (based on propaganda posters)
***** Overview

## Inspiration

This art style feels like it could lend itself well to a card game. In particular the Demands Sacrifice one.



[[https://twitter.com/rob_sheridan][Artist I originally saw doing propoganda style posters]]
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._C._Leyendecker][JC Leyendecker - Popular propaganda artist]]

**** Strategic RPG Dungeon Crawler

Shared board with populated dungeons players will "race" to defeat for reward to try and grow stronger. Push your luck element to take on bigger "camps" to grow stronger but real element of risk/reward etc.  Threats grow over time potentially and you need to "gear up" to take on bigger camps. 

**** Space Civilization Dice Game
***** Overview

## Overview

A dice game about building civilizations. The game is a thinky filler (most likely) with dice drafting and yahtzee style dice combo mechanisms. To start the game each player draws X dice from the dice bag. They then each take turns rolling them towards each other, each player rolling one die, until all dice are rolled. This forms the game board. Players now place 2 civilization disks. (snaking by turn order, last places 2). 

Players start with the same starting hand of cards. (hand management). New cards can be "researched" as a type of action. 

Upgrading a civilizaiton enables you to use more resources around it and creates a larger zone of control. 

Possibly one must trace a line using their "cable" to reach dice for chaining.

Dice tick down meaning a 5 ‚Üí 4 ‚Üí 3 style count down so if you use a 5 on a red die that die ticks down to 4 after you have resolved the action it's part of.  Dice can be combo'd and chained for more advanced cards creating "straights" and flushes. 

### Components:

Colored D6's, A dice bag, Bits of "cord" that serve as rulers ( various length and in player color), cards.

***** Ideas from the internet (/u/almostcyclops)

I like the sound of your game. It's actually very similar to the planet generation I was using in my own design until I decided to go all cards. If I'm being honest I think you're in the same default mindset of "bigger number equals more/better", since you say the number on the die is the quantity of resource. This is a fine approach, but I dont think it aligns with your interest in using runs of numbers to trigger abilities. A run of 4 sixes may indeed be more powerful than a run of 4 ones, but how do you thematically justify a straight? One possible fix would be to have each color correspond to a type of planet and each face be a resource type. Then you could have one ability that requires 5 titanium (a specific yachtzee) and a different ability require one each of titanium, eden incense, space potatoes, and warp juice (a small straight). You could go further by having different planet types have different probabilities of different resources (like an earth like planet die having 3 space potato faces). Some resources would be more rare than others across the board and abilities that use them could be more powerful. Naturally, players fight over these rarer resources, but some powerful abilities could just require a ton of common resources. This let's a player be sneaky and gobble up planets others think are less desirable. Of course you also dont need to waste the colors on just resource distribution, as some abilities may not care at all about resource only planet type. Thus there is natural synergy between an abity that cares about planet type, and another that cares about resources common to that type (but with a little press your luck, since despite the odds you can never guarantee a certain resource will spawn). All of this has the downside/upside of using custom dice (though could be completely play tested using regular dice and a lookup chart).

**** Factories
***** Overview

Possible name supply chain

Square grid 2 factory sizes  4 or 8 sections is. 1x1 or 2x2. This dictates max input output

A factory can have :

- 1 in 3 out
- 2 in 2 out
- 3 in 1 out
- 4 in
- Or 4 out (a resource node)

Cards in hand used to design factory

Excess goods are sold or moved down the supply chain. (if you have enough out puts)

Warehouses act as nodes in your supply chain to help you get low output goods farther down your chain. 

Need to look at how rebuilding your supply chain works

***** Solo Consideration

# Campaign Style with Memory

Sprawling world map with factory prototyping. Modify my "factory" tray design to instead of being something you set tokens onto that you slide them into and "cap off". Basic and advanced factory designs. Multi floor designs. Beautiful 3d Factory pieces that inset into each "floor" tray (game ships with tokens in a tuckbox ala a legacy game. Includes a qr code for stl files to 3d print for your next game session.  Turn based "Dial" system. that utilizes Days  weeks and months with matching production cycles.  

## Game Subsystems

- Research system
- Logistics  & transportation system
- Multiple ore systems
- Factory and reFactoring.
- sticker system for factory and logistics placement.

**** Co-op CCG RPG

# Why the CCG Model? More than a cash grab?

CCG Model because I don't want people to have to spend money on a MASSIVE set in order to get all the possible variety. Only spend extra time in modules you love. It also has to do with exploration and variety.  

Different module types: 

1. Standalone  - These are small one off add ins that work with any set and likely will have some set pairing recommendations
2. Side? Quest Packs - These tie into a module ( or modules) and will add extra story and missions to what you already loved. They are high level and recommended to be used alongside or after the core module content.  Tons of different quest packs and each pack will have a level range. 
3. Standard - This is a core module that has everything you need for the main story lines. What happens here will lead you to the booster packs. The booster packs will leverage the base sets here. There will usually be a theme around these. 
4. Large - These will have more than one pre-built module tied to it, think of this more like a dedicated campaign

# Mechanisms

## Expanding on the encounter card system

I like arkhams system but I feel like there is a way to create a fall through or randomization system to add variety. 

As an example a perticular quest might have you choose 1 particular encounter set for its specific mechanisms but then it will tell you to choose a random Low Level Chaotic Evil Humanoid Minion and that could be a few different types of things. There will also be hidden and obscured placeholder encounter cards that reveal what they are as you uncover things on your mission.

The goal here is to create a system that has a sense of uniqueness, emergence and cohesion all at the same time. In the above example the Level indicator tells you that the level will be in a certain range near you, the chaotic evil type hints at its motivation and what it wants, it's why. The humanoid typing shares characteristics in terms of weaknesses, strengths, stats etc and the minion typing suggests the depth of variety and interestingness given to this group. A minion group would be equivalent to the default cultists where as enemies would be more like the cultists found in Carcossa and the Leader or Boss typing would be like the cultists found in the Circle undone.

## Experiential Granularity

I want people to be able to experience a half or full campaign like playing a full campaign in arkham but I want those campaigns to be connected over a larger experience like Gloomhaven.  However I want the world to be even bigger. I want a large trackable map where time impacts things. I want NPCs to die of old age. I want things to matter. I want discovery and exploration. I want PCs to die. I want new PCs to be interesting and not tack-ons. I want them to join into the world  in a meaningful way. 

## Character Death and Replacement

When a character dies I want it to have impact on the world. I also want the new character to not just be ok time to make a new character. 

To that end I want to build some effects from death. I'll need to ruminate on that more though. 

For replacement the player replacing the character will create a new character that has a level equal to the lowest in the group currently. This process will be, a process. As you play your game and develop your world you will build and modify over time a set of decks that is used to "simulate" the life of your character. This will have more uses too. This will be used to generate important NPCs as well. 

### Sample features

- As new regions, cities etc are discovered cards will be added to the simulation decks. This means that that new city of gastroport might be the birthplace of your new character where he joined the Green Street Thugs  ( a faction). This gives him starting reputation with that faction and some of his skills that lean roguish.
- A player will make decisions that lead down paths. (This shouldn't be fully random but more of a mini game with a flow chart style to it) so maybe he goes full rogue and starts a life of crime or perhaps he veers over towards magic due to having stolen an artifact and learning magic.
- this process should be fun and engaging and cool to watch.  it shouldn't be too long. But it should make character creation fun and help you create a character you can't wait to play.
- After creating the character the system will help you craft a mission that represents how the current party meets the new character and then comes to fall in with them.

**** Create animated infographics for board games

These should hit a few different categories: 

- How to play ( each phase is an infographic) [These will become instagram galleries & short youtube videos]
- Create one to showcase how a mechanism works
- Help showcase & break apart game systems.

** 3D Printing
*** Dactyl Manuform
**** My Notes

I'm using standard Prusa Slicer supports, spacing at 3mm. Set your vertical offset to 0.3mm and turn support extrusion down to like 80% of normal and they will release much more easily.
